# Guessing Game (guess.py)

This is the guessing game, where you think of a specific number and the computer guesses it. It tests my skill to program in python and sometimes to remember a number.

## Getting Started

Install the latest version of Python (tested on Windows 10 x64).

Execute the following command:

```.\guess.py```

Select any number (integer) between 1 and infinity.

Think and remember a number between 1 and what you picked.

# Chess Moveset (chessercise.py ...)

This is the utility program for figuring out where almost any specific chess piece can move.

## Getting Started

Install the latest version of Python (tested on Windows 10 x64).

Test the submission with the following command:

```.\chessercise_test.py```

Compare the end of the output with the following lines, for success:
```
